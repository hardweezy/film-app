This movie was so bad I can't put into words. I loved Blade Runner but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original.

Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and not in a good way

As people left the theater I saw shaking heads.

Don't understand people raving about it. They must be connected to the film somehow.

Save your money, watch the original and don't let this ruin it for you like it did for me
