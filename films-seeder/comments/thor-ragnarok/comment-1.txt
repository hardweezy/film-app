First of all I wanna say, Hela is amazing.Best villain I ve ever seen since the Joker(Of course not the God awful joker from s.squad.The joker from dark knight)

Action scenes were so incredible. Fenrir, Surtur, Hela, Sakaar, Hulk, Thor, Gladiator-battle arena,demolition of Asgard etc..so damn epic.I am glad they put comedy on this last Thor movie cause the Thor 1 and 2 were all serious movies,especially Thor was a serious character.This didn't work out so they tried to make a funnier,more entertaining movie.In my opinion it was a great move.Cause there were so many emotional moments and deaths in this movie.

Btw,be ready for very surprising deaths and cameos.

I didn't mind the comedy cause they put all the jokes in right places.Just like they did in Guardians of the Galaxy,Ant man and FOX did in Deadpool.

Also I am not allergic to comedy or having fun if they make it right.I am not one of those moody,goth/emo,depressing people with boring,dull life.

I am very satisfied with this movie.Now it is time for JUSTICE LEAGUE.I really hope that movie will be great too. I liked WONDER WOMAN a lot,hope J.L will be as good as that.
